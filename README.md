An efficient framework for generic NoSQL data stores

The goal of this work is to define a general approach for enabling efficient queries and storage of semi-structured, hierarchical data, with reference to several NoSQL systems. Data is stored and accessed by using a common, XPath-like query language, which gets seamlessly translated into sys- tems native operations. Likewise, our platform maps objects data into systems native structures by exploiting high-level, declarative translations.
In detail, we want to pursue the following objectives:
1. Store and access data by using a uniform interface,
hiding the specific details of the underlying systems.
